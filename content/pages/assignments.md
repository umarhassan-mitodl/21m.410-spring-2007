Additionally, students will conduct inquiry into works indicative of their own heritage. The term ends with a class recital.

Class Recital
-------------

Each student will select three or four works to perform for the class recital at the end of the semester. These selections should represent a cross-section of the works studied throughout the semester. In determining the performance order of the pieces, students may consider language, key signature, and level of vocal difficulty. Students will write program notes for the recital, including biographical information on the composers, poets, lyricists, and librettists, as well as any necessary translations.
